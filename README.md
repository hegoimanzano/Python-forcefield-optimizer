# PyField

 This is a forcefield optimization tool. This tool allows you to optimize your classical forcefield based on Quantum Chemistry calculations. At this point, the following forcefields are supported: 
- REAX-FF

Also the following features are implemented:

- Supported OS
    - Linux (tested on Ubuntu 20.04)
    - Also works with windows linux subsystem (tested on Ubuntu 20.04)
- Modes of execution
    - Serial execution: It is good for small molecular systems. We will soon release the parallel version.
- Types of optimization
    - Energy
    - Charge
- Optimization methods
    - ##### Simulated annealing
    - Genetic Algorithm
